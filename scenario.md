### Scenario-Based Question: Cryptography and Network Security

**Scenario:**  
A small online store collects customer information, such as names, addresses, and credit card details, during checkout. Recently, customers have reported unauthorized transactions on their cards, and the store owner suspects a data breach.

The owner has asked you, a cybersecurity consultant, to help secure their website and protect sensitive customer information.

---

**Tasks:**

1. **Data Encryption:**  
   Recommend a method to encrypt customers’ sensitive information during checkout. Should they use **symmetric encryption** (e.g., AES) or **asymmetric encryption** (e.g., RSA)? Explain your choice with an example.

2. **Secure Web Communication:**  
   Suggest a simple way to ensure secure communication between the website and customers’ browsers (e.g., using HTTPS). Why is HTTPS important? How does it prevent data breaches?

3. **Password Security:**  
   The store owner stores customer account passwords in plain text. Explain why this is dangerous and suggest a better approach (e.g., hashing passwords with a salt).

4. **SQL Injection Prevention:**  
   If the website uses a database to store customer details, suggest one simple method to prevent SQL injection attacks.

**Evaluation Criteria:**  
- Clear understanding of basic cryptography and security principles.  
- Ability to propose simple, effective solutions.  
- Explanation of concepts with practical examples, like using HTTPS or password hashing.
