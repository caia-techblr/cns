### Workflow Using Wazuh

1. **Deployment**:  
   - Wazuh is deployed on servers, endpoints, and network devices.  
   - Agents are installed on endpoints, and the central Wazuh Manager is configured to collect and analyze data.  

2. **Log Collection**:  
   - Wazuh agents collect logs from various sources, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and operating systems.  
   - Logs are sent to the Wazuh Manager for centralized analysis.  

3. **Threat Detection**:  
   - Wazuh uses pre-configured rules and machine learning algorithms to analyze logs and detect suspicious activities, such as:  
     - Unauthorized access attempts.  
     - Brute-force attacks on SSH or RDP.  
     - Anomalous behavior, like data exfiltration.  
   - Real-time alerts are generated when threats are identified.  

4. **Vulnerability Assessment**:  
   - Wazuh scans endpoints and servers for vulnerabilities.  
   - Generates a detailed report listing misconfigurations, outdated software, and missing patches.  

5. **Compliance Monitoring**:  
   - Wazuh enforces compliance with security standards such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, or GDPR by monitoring system configurations.  
   - Alerts are triggered for any non-compliance issues, helping the team remediate them quickly.  

6. **Incident Response**:  
   - When a threat is detected, automated responses are triggered (e.g., blocking IP addresses, terminating malicious processes).  
   - Security analysts investigate using detailed logs and alerts provided by Wazuh.  

7. **Reporting**:  
   - Generate actionable reports and dashboards for stakeholders.  
   - Use data insights to improve the organization's security posture over time.

## Example: Detecting and Mitigating a Brute-Force SSH Attack

1. **Scenario**:  
   A malicious actor attempts a brute-force attack on the corporate server’s SSH service.  

2. **Steps with Wazuh**:  
   - **Detection**: Wazuh detects multiple failed SSH login attempts in a short period.  
   - **Alert**: An alert is generated with details about the source IP, timestamp, and number of attempts.  
   - **Response**: Wazuh triggers an automated script to block the attacker’s IP in the firewall.  

3. **Outcome**:  
   - The brute-force attack is successfully mitigated without manual intervention.  
   - A report of the incident is created for further analysis.
