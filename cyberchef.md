## Scenario 1: Security Analyst Investigating Suspicious Logs

**Actors**:  
- **Security Analyst**: A professional investigating logs for potential threats.  
- **CyberChef**: The tool used to analyze and process the data.

**Problem**:  
The analyst receives a suspicious server log file containing Base64-encoded data. The data may contain malware or malicious code, but the exact content is unknown.

**Workflow Using CyberChef**:
1. **Data Ingestion**:  
   The analyst uploads the server log file to CyberChef.

2. **Decoding**:  
   - Apply the "From Base64" operation to decode the data.  
   - CyberChef instantly displays the decoded content in the output pane.

3. **Pattern Search**:  
   - Use "Extract Strings" to identify suspicious file names or IP addresses embedded in the decoded data.  
   - Use "Regex Search" to pinpoint malicious patterns (e.g., IP addresses or suspicious commands).

4. **Further Analysis**:  
   - If the decoded data is compressed, apply the "Gunzip" operation to decompress it.  
   - Use "SHA-256 Hash" to verify the file's hash against known malware databases.

5. **Outcome**:  
   The analyst discovers a malicious script embedded in the logs and reports it to the incident response team for mitigation.

## Scenario 2: Developer Debugging an API

**Actors**:  
- **Developer**: A software engineer troubleshooting API requests.  
- **CyberChef**: The tool used to analyze the API data.

**Problem**:  
The API returns data in a URL-encoded format, making it hard to read and debug.

**Workflow Using CyberChef**:
1. **Data Processing**:  
   - Copy the API response and paste it into CyberChef.  
   - Apply the "URL Decode" operation to transform the response into a readable format.

2. **Validation**:  
   - Use "JSON Beautify" to structure the JSON response for better readability.  
   - Inspect key-value pairs to identify discrepancies.

3. **Encoding Check**:  
   - Test encoding issues by applying "URL Encode" to the modified data and comparing it with the original API response.

4. **Outcome**:  
   The developer identifies and fixes an encoding issue in the API request, resolving the bug.

## Scenario 3: Forensic Investigator Decoding Obfuscated Malware

**Actors**:  
- **Forensic Investigator**: A cybersecurity expert analyzing malware samples.  
- **CyberChef**: The tool used to decode obfuscation.

**Problem**:  
The investigator receives a PowerShell script that contains obfuscated commands.

**Workflow Using CyberChef**:
1. **Data Input**:  
   - Paste the PowerShell script into CyberChef.

2. **Deobfuscation**:  
   - Use "Find and Replace" to normalize the script (e.g., replacing variables with actual values).  
   - Apply "ROT13" or "Base64 Decode" operations to reveal hidden commands.

3. **Analysis**:  
   - Use "Entropy Calculation" to detect encrypted or compressed sections.  
   - Decrypt suspected encrypted sections using "AES Decrypt" with known keys or patterns.

4. **Outcome**:  
   The investigator uncovers malicious behavior encoded in the script and prepares a detailed report.
